I am setting up a recipes website.
I practiced putting an image on a website.
I also practiced using headers, paragraphs, and lists. 
I added two sites to the recipes website after a 2 month break. 
It is difficult to remember what I learned 2 months ago.
I also figured out why I couldn't update the site. My repo was not set to read and write permissions. 
I am ready to move on to the next lesson even though I know that I have a lot to review.
